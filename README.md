## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You must have Node.js (v18 or later) and npm installed on your machine.

### Local Setup

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    - The React app will open on `http://localhost:3000`.
    - The Node.js server will run on `http://localhost:5000`.
